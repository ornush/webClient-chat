WebClient Project

We wrote a webClient chat that contains at least 5 members chatting eith each other. 
the chat includes masseges like sound records, pictures, files, videos and text
we have used js,HTML,bootsrap and CSS.

what you'll need to install:
1.bsoivbseiuoibeivo

after you download everything you finally can run the WebClient.html on your broswer  
you will need to enter your:
1. User Name (should be at least 6 letter with no numbers at all)****
2. Nick Name (will apear in the chatBox) 
3. Picture
