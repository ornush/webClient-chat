`##`WebClient Project

We wrote a webClient chat that contains at least 5 members chatting with each other. 
In the chat you can interact and send masseges like sounds records, pictures, files, videos and text.

what you'll need to install:
1.run npm init in the cmd on the folder path 


After you download all the files you finally can run the Login or SignUp pages on Your broswer  

**if you want to Register choose "login.html" page**
you will need to enter your:
1. User Name (should include 4 Characters)
2. Nick Name (should include 4 Characters -will apear in the chatBox) 

When you are login, you wiil need to enter with one of our harded coded users from the Array below 

 users = [
  username: 'Brian1', nickname: 'Brian', password: 'e1234'
  username: 'Trevor1', nickname: 'Trevor', password: 'a1234'
   username: 'Jonathan1', nickname: 'Jonathan', password: 'w1234'
