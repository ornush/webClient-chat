 # WebClient Project 


We wrote a webClient chat that contains at least 5 members chatting with each other. 
In the chat you can interact and send masseges like sounds records, pictures, files, videos and text.

what you'll need to install:<br />1.run npm init in the cmd on the folder path 


After you download all the files you finally can run the Login or SignUp pages on Your broswer  

**if you want to Register choose "login.html" page**
you will need to enter your:
1. User Name (should include 4 Characters)
2. Nick Name (should include 4 Characters -will apear in the chatBox) 

When you are logged in, you will need to enter with one of our harded coded users from the Array below 

 users = [<br />
  username: 'Brian1', nickname: 'Brian', password: 'e1234'<br />
  username: 'Trevor1', nickname: 'Trevor', password: 'a1234'<br />
